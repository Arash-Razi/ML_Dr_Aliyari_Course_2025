# ML_Dr_Aliyari_Course_2025
This repository has been created as part of the Machine Learning course under Dr.Aliyari.
It serves as a collection of all mini projects developed throughout the semester. Each project is organized into its own dedicated folder for clarity and ease of navigation. The aim of this repository is to document the learning process, showcase practical applications of machine learning concepts covered in class, and provide a structured archive of the work completed during the course.
